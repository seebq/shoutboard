Shoutboard

This application was written during the Big Nerd Ranch Ruby on Rails Bootcamp in 2007.

The Shoutboard allows anyone to post a link, or code snippets for the rest of the class to see.

It's a simple app, built on Rails 1.2 (old as of today).

It could use a few upgrades:

* Upgrade to newest 2.x version of Rails
* Allow code pasting to pastie through the API

Enjoy!
